# form-playground

A playground created for building different boiler plate form components using different methods and tools.  Sample methods include Formik, class Components, class extensions and functional renderings, among others.

To view and test different form types, copy and paste the content from each folder in "dev_methods" into the corresponding files noted in their comments.

A notes file is included in each "dev_method" folder noting current state of development, issues, and limitations/strengths of each respective method.
